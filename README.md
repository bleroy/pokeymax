# PokeyMax 4

Foft's public designs for PokeyMax.

Pokeys are getting rare and expensive. FPGA alternative exist but are also expensive. Foft, the author of PokeyMax, has very generously made his designs public on [the AtariAge forums](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/362961-regular-pokey-in-fpga/).
With his permission, I'm publishing his latest iteration on PokeyMax, version 4, which is a 2-layer version with all components on the top side. This should be easier to produce at a lower cost than the previous versions. I've also imported the project in KiCad from the original Eagle files.

Foft has not specified a license for his work, but attribution should be maintained. This is his design, reproduced here under his permission.
